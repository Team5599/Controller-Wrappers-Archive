# Controller-Wrappers-Archive

Contains all the Java wrappers we have for the different types of controllers we own.

This includes the following Controllers:
* Microsoft XBox360 Controller
* Logitech Dual Action Controller
* Sony PlayStation3 Controller (*With the use of an extneral wrapping program, like DS3 Tool*)


And Joystick Controllers:
* Logitech Attack 3 Joystick
* Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick

Hopefully we will add support for the XBox One, Play Station 4, and Steam Controllers.

## For the PS3 Controller Wrapper
You must use an external program like DS3 Tool, Better DS3, or MotionJoy.
These convert the PS3 controller's outputs into a Windows readable format (Usually XBox360) by tricking Windows into thinking something like an XBox controller is plugged in.

We're not responsible for the bugginess of these external tools, and advise you to use them at your own caution.
